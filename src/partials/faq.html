        <h3 class="title">How long is the game?</h3>
        <p class="description">

        <h3 class="title">Does the sword really grow forever?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Sort of! Your sword expands with your combo chain and can become
          hilariously long — but controlling it gets harder the longer it gets!

        <h3 class="title">Will there be updates?</h3>

          Yes, we plan seasonal content, bonus levels, and more silly side
          characters in future patches.
